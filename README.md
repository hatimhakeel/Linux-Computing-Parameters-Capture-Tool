# Linux-Computing-Parameters-Capture-Tool

This project runs several linux commands and gathers information regarding computing parameters of a linux
node. It was written sometime ago. The current version has many code smells removed but not completely.

Possible future additions

1) Further refactoring
2) Mavenifying (Wonder if it's the correct way to call it :))
